# Fantasy-Name-Generator

I play tabletop roleplaying games, and usually I act as the gamemaster. In such games, it's the gamemasters job to present stories to the players. Often, this involves coming up with many character names that sound appropriate in the context of a medieval fantasy setting. This app is designed to help with that task. It lets the user randomly generate such names, mark her favorites, and quickly share the list of favorites.

This is mainly an educational project, although I hope to publish it when I feel it's ready. It's intended to help me improve my iOS development skills, with an emphasis on learning Swift.

Currently, the main functionality is implemented, although the interface is visually very basic.
